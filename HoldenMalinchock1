I love open source becuase it creates a flow of ideas.  It is not just one idea or one perspective on a project, it is a 
lot of very smart engineers and programmers comming together to share ideas and find the best way possible to do things.  It 
is a great medium for working in a team envoirment.  You can all submit code and build a project together and not have to 
copy paste files, it is all so seemless and enjoyable.
