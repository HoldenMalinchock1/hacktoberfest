I am a computer undergraduate,second year majoring in Computer Engineering at Delhi Technological University(DTU).I was fascinated toward this field since very long and had Computer Science since my 11th grade.I love to code and see how writing lines of code allows any machine to do a desired task.With years passing by technology is changing our way of living and outlook towards life.This whatâ€™s the magic we as coders can chant on the common folks and improve the standards and ease of life.
With my branch for the next two years and college and further learning all the algorithms,maths and their application to things which I could never have even imagined is great.With knowledge of my field I would love to spread my knowledge for the betterment of the society all together. I just want to contribute to the society with the coding skills I have and to inspire more people especially women to come up and showcase their talent.
 I have worked on projects on Android since the past one year and loved the engrossing experience as a developer it provides. I am a good learner and recently learned HaxeFlixel and OpenGL for my self study in my fourth semester on which I am further honing my skills on . I love to learn and contribute. 
  The biggest projects that I have done include Hunger App and Pong Game amongst others.
Further I have good knowledge in C,C++,JAVA,HTML,Android,CSS,HAxeFlixel and OpenGL,and SDL.I have been coding since my 11th grade which is equivalent to four years now.I also do competitive coding on HackerRank and Codechef.
I am a coding enthusiast and can leave everything else for it. I just want to contribute to the society with the coding skills and what good place to find other than open source projects.
